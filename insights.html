                        <p>Are you innovating to improve your product portfolio and keep up with the competition? Then
                            it
                            makes sense to use all the tax breaks available to you as the corporate tax rises. The
                            patent
                            box scheme is one of the most attractive tax incentives in the UK...

                            patent box scheme is one of the most attractive tax incentives in the UK and is now closely
                            tied to R&D tax incentives: you can get tax incentives for the development of your
                            intellectual property and a lower tax rate on profits from its use.</p>
                    </div>

            <div class="insights-main__item-footer display__none">
                <p>If you haven't chosen a patent box scheme yet, it's time to check how it can benefit your business in
                    2023 and beyond.</p>
                <h4>Benefits</h4>
                <p>Profits eligible for the patent box exemption are effectively taxed at just 10%, up from a base
                    corporate tax rate of 25% from 2023. And you do not need to patent a completely new product, even a
                    small holistic patent on one of your products will give you access to all the benefits of the patent
                    box regime.</p>
                <p>The main criteria for access to this valuable relief are as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You own or hold an exclusive license to an EU or UK patent;</li>
                    <li>The company that owns the patents also carried out the R&D that led to their creation;
                        and</li>
                    <li>You can track and trace the relationship between research and development, patents and
                        their revenue.</li>
                    <li>Apart from that, the calculation of the patent box is pretty much of a formulaic nature,
                        so once you set up the process of collecting information, it can work without interruption
                        for many years.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>It is also possible to structure the group so that the IP company is shielded from major trading
                    activities (thereby protecting it in the event of bankruptcy), but still entitled to an effective
                    10% corporate tax rate on license income. receives from the group's sales organizations.</p>

                <p>Although the rules were introduced in 2017, many organizations and charities still fail to comply
                    with them. The requirements are being met and have received a lot of attention from various
                    organizations over the past twelve months.</p>
                <h4>Who's affected?</h4>
                <p>The requirements apply to charitable companies (including limited liability companies with shares and
                    guarantees) and the public interest that meet two of the following criteria:</p>
                <div class="arovw-second__ita">Revenue <img src="img/GreenArrowRight.svg" alt=""> £ 36m</div>
                <div class="arovw-second__ita">Total assets <img src="img/GreenArrowRight.svg" alt=""> £ 18m</div>
                <div class="arovw-second__ita">Employees <img src="img/GreenArrowRight.svg" alt=""> £ 250m</div>
                <h4>What does it mean?</h4>
                <p>A charity meeting the above criteria may be required to publish a report on the government portal
                    BEIS. <br>
                    There are usually two reporting periods in a standard fiscal year, each spanning six months of the
                    respective fiscal year. For non-standard fiscal years, such as shortened or extended periods, the
                    reporting requirements and therefore the corresponding timing may differ. The required information
                    must be published within 30 days after the end of the reporting period. <br>
                    The rules state that if an organization does not publish its report or provides false information in
                    the report, it is considered a criminal offense and the company and directors will be fined if
                    convicted under the summary procedure. However, BIES commented that it “will generally seek to
                    induce businesses to comply with the reporting requirement before prosecutions are taken.”</p>
                <h4>Action</h4>
                <p>Trustees of charities that meet the criteria or are truly close to the thresholds should make sure
                    they are familiar with the requirements and make sure their charities are meeting their <br>
                    reporting responsibilities. Trustees should also review the reported performance and consider
                    whether their charitable activities are performing at an acceptable level, how their reports can be
                    viewed by third parties and stakeholders, and whether their payment policies and procedures are
                    reliable. <br>
                    If any of the above questions raise any questions, BDO is well placed to provide support and advice
                    on these rules and broader working capital issues.</p>

                <h4>Which companies are affected by IR35 in the private sector?</h4>
                <p>The new rules are similar to those used for the IR35 public sector reforms in 2017, but go further in
                    a number of respects (and these extensions also apply to public sector enterprises from April 2021).
                    However, private sector rules will only apply to medium and large enterprises, with the definition
                    of small businesses exempt from taxation based largely on the definition of small company in the
                    Companies Act 2006. At the request of an employee (or an organization that concludes a contract with
                    an end customer), any organization must confirm within 45 days whether it is considered "small" in
                    accordance with these rules</p>
                <h4>How will IR35 affect your business?</h4>
                <p>The changes affect organizations that engage workers through Personal Service Companies (PSCs) or any
                    other intermediary such as a partnership or LLP. This is because the new rules will require the
                    employing organization (client) to assess whether the intermediary rules (IR35) apply to contracts
                    it enters into with any PSC employed directly or through third parties. <br>
                    If the customer determines that IR35 applies, the individual or legal entity paying the PSC (payer
                    of the commission) must apply the PAYE and NIC deductions to employee fees. In other words, they
                    must treat the employee as a prospective employee for tax purposes. In addition, the payer should
                    also consider the employer's NIC and possibly a tuition fee.</p>
                <p>These changes can lead to an increase in the operating costs of your business:</p>
                <p>+ <span>Directly as a result of paying a commission</span></p>
                <p>+ <span>Indirectly, as organizations down the supply chain seek to increase their fees to mitigate
                        potential increases in their tax and NIC liabilities.</span></p>
                <p>The government's response to the implementation review confirmed that it will be cautious about
                    penalties for errors in the first year of the new rules. However, businesses need to take their new
                    commitments seriously to avoid being listed as HMRC's risks for years to come.</p>
                <p>If you do need to assess your situation, it is important to define your PSC usage profile and perhaps
                    your broader portfolio of non-payroll employees both now and as part of any new business model you
                    adopt. Your key stakeholders will need to have a clear understanding of:</p>
                <p>+ <span>How many PSCs do you use?</span></p>
                <p>+ <span>Which parts of your business use them?</span></p>
                <p>+ <span>How are they used?</span></p>
                <p>+ <span>How important they are to different parts of the business?</span></p>
                <p>This portfolio analysis will clarify which commercial contracts are awarded and whether they are fit
                    for purpose. Based on our experience in helping organizations to date, it is often appropriate to
                    introduce updated contracts that meet the needs of the organization in the event that IR35 will
                    apply to a specific arrangement. <br>
                    Once all PSC use has been identified, processes must be put in place to ensure that the IR35
                    assessment is completed prior to employee interaction provided through the PSC. It is clear that it
                    is very important to determine which part of the business will be responsible for the IR35
                    verification process and to consider what level of knowledge exists in the business. You may need to
                    train and support the appropriate staff.</p>

                    In accordance with the Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive, all real estate agents and auctioneers
                    are

                    criminals could use the business for financial crime.
                    To protect against money laundering, there is a legal responsibility to conduct customer due

                    (CDD) on a buyer and a seller before establishing a business relationship or conducting a

                    In one case, a marketing executive named only Amber received £ 1,900 in arrears following an HMRC
                    investigation. <br>
                    Overall, HMRC says it helped Brits recover more than £ 16 million in unpaid wages in the past tax
                    year. <br>
                    All UK workers are legally entitled to a national minimum wage based on your age.</p>
                <p>Now HMRC has explained some of the most absurd reasons employers refused to pay for this:</p>
                <h4>This includes:</h4>

                    <li>
                        “She doesn’t deserve the state minimum wage because she only makes tea and sweeps floors.”

                    <li>
                        “The employee was not a good employee, so I didn’t think he deserved to be paid the state

                    <li>
                        “My accountant and I speak a different language – he does not understand me and therefore does
                        not pay my employees the correct wages.”

                    <li>
                        “My employee is still studying, so he is not eligible for the national minimum wage.”
                    </li>
                    “It’s part of British culture not to pay young workers for the first three months because they have

                    <li>
                        “The National Minimum Wage does not apply to my business.”

                        “The National Minimum Wage does not apply to my business.”

                    <li>
                        “I have an agreement with my workers that I will not pay them the national minimum wage; they
                        understand, and they even signed a contract to that effect. “
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        “I thought it was okay to pay young workers below the national minimum wage as they are not
                        British and therefore not eligible for that wage.”
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        “My workers like to think of themselves as self-employed and the national minimum wage does not

                    <li>
                        Steve Timewell, HMRC’s director of private individuals and small businesses, said: “Most UK
                        employers pay their workers at least the national minimum wage, but this list shows some of the
                        excuses given to our law enforcement by less scrupulous businesses.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        “Low wages are no joke for workers, so we always apply the law and take action. Employees cannot
                        be asked or asked to give up their rights.

                    <li>
                        “We make sure that workers get what they are entitled to, and as the economy recovers, we remind
                        employers of the rules and the assistance that is available to them.”
                    </li>

                <h4>What is the minimum wage?</h4>
                <p>The national minimum wage starts at £ 4.30 per hour for those working as an apprentice. <br>
                    If you are under 18, the minimum amount you can receive is £ 4.62 per hour, rising to £ 6.56 for
                    those ages 18-20 and £ 8.36 for those ages 21 to 22 years old.<br>
                    Individuals aged 23 and over earn the national subsistence minimum wage and are eligible for a
                    minimum of £ 8.91 per hour.</p>
                <p>Hourly rates currently:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    £ 8.91 – Age 23 and Over (National Living Wage)
                    <br>

                    £ 8.36 – Age 21-22
                    <br>

                    £ 6.56 – Ages 18-20
                    <br>

                    £ 4.62 – under 18
                    <br>

                    £ 4.30 – Apprentice
                    <br>

                    Workers are entitled to correct wages, even if they are working on a temporary basis, working
                    part-time or on a temporary basis, or if they have not yet received training.
                </p>
                <p>People who do not have to pay a minimum amount include self-employed and self-employed businesses,
                    company directors and volunteers.</p>
                <h4>How to check if you have received underpaid payments?</h4>
                <p>To make sure you're underpaid, you need to look at your payrolls and compare them to the minimum
                    rates. <br>
                    If you think you are not being paid enough, you should first talk to your employer to give them a
                    chance to remedy the situation.<br>
                    If this does not resolve the issue, you can file a complaint with HMRC through the Gov.uk website.
                    <br>
                    They then investigate your complaint, and if you are underpaid, you will refund the money owed.

                    FCA believes Binance is in breach of several regulatory requirements, including failure to meet a
                    threshold condition for effective oversight.<br><br>
                    Specifically, the FCA stated that Binance declined to answer questions about its broader global
                    business model and declined or was unable to provide information on the broader products offered
                    through Binance.com.<br><br>
                    At the time, Binance said, “[Some] FCA questions are about the Binance Group's general agreements
                    and certain corporate information pertaining to the Binance Group.<br><br>
                    "With the exception of the Binance companies disclosed above, the other entities in the Binance
                    group have nothing to do with Binance Markets Ltd (BML) and the UK business."<br><br>
                    Regarding the second question, the firm added: “Entities in the Binance group that trade through
                    Binance.com are not involved in any of the activities carried out by BML. Therefore, we do not
                    consider this question pertinent or in any way related to the BML application. "<br><br>
                    FCA also reported that Binance did not respond to questions regarding Binance Stock Tokens, provided
                    clarification on the legal and regulatory status of the product, or did not submit a product
                    prospectus to FCA.<br><br>

                    As a result, the FCA believes that Binance is “unable to carry out regulated activities for more
                    than 12 months” and therefore considers the requirements it has imposed on the firm “proportionate
                    and appropriate”.<br><br>
                    “Requirements are urgently needed, given the severity of the risks and the need to protect
                    consumers,” the observer concluded.<br><br>
                    The cryptocurrency exchange, whose holding company is registered in the Cayman Islands, has scaled
                    back its product offering and said it intends to work with global regulators to comply with local
                    regulations, according to Reuters.<br><br>
                    CoinGecko digital currency market analysis platform estimates Binance's 24-hour trading volume at $

                <p>The window was closed even more due to a security warning at the airport. The UK and the US have told
                    people to avoid the terminal for fear of a terrorist attack. <br><br>
                    Mr Johnson said the most vulnerable Afghans who served NATO forces during the 20-year mission have
                    already been transported to safety. <br><br>
                    “In any case, we are approaching the end of this stage in the sense that we have already airlifted a
                    huge number of people from Afghanistan,” he said. <br><br>
                    “We are indebted to them. These are the people who took care of our military forces, helped during
                    the 20 years of Great Britain's involvement in Afghanistan. <br><br>
                    "The real challenge now is to make sure they have housing, they have the skills, they have the
                    opportunity to integrate into our society." <br><br>
                    Many Afghans left their homes with a bag on their backs and relied on donations of food, clothing
                    and hygiene items. <br><br>
                    Care4Calais, a charity founded six years ago to help asylum seekers in France hoping to make it to
                    Britain, said it was overwhelmed with donations following an appeal from the City Council of
                    Manchester. <br><br>
                    A refugee support manager at the British Red Cross said the community's “avalanche of love” is
                    helping the charity support those in need. <br><br>
                    Charity staff and volunteers welcomed new arrivals at airports and provided them with basic
                    necessities such as warm clothing and hygiene kits. <br><br>
                    Red Cross teams support families in Heathrow, Leicester, Chelmsford, Colchester, Hertfordshire,
                    Southampton, Hampshire, Derby, Cheshire, Birmingham, Bryze Norton and Wrexham. <br><br>
                    Manchester, the third largest city in the UK, is currently home to some 1,000 displaced Afghans.
                    There are hundreds of refugees in West and North Yorkshire, Hertfordshire and several other
                    counties. <br><br>
                    “Hundreds of people have arrived in the UK with their families just after a painful journey, leaving
                    homes and loved ones in insecurity,” said refugee manager Edmore Hute. <br><br>
                    “First of all, we show kindness and assure them that they are in a safe place, in a safe place. This
                    is vital, especially in these early days, in the early hours and days. " <br><br>
                    Afghan refugees are to be quarantined for 10 days under the UK's traffic light system to limit the
                    spread of Covid-19. <br><br>
                    The demand for housing means that officials have been forced to accommodate refugees in hotels
                    across the UK. London Mayor Sadiq Khan unveiled plans to help local councils buy houses that could
                    be used to relocate Afghan families. <br><br>
                    One of the largest healthcare providers in the UK announced Thursday that it will train 500 Afghan
                    refugees in care work. <br><br>
                    Cera, which has 70 offices in England, Scotland and Wales, hopes to recruit refugees arriving under
                    the UK's resettlement program over the next five years. <br><br>
                    Ministers say the scheme, which does not involve the evacuation of Afghan personnel working for NATO
                    forces, will reach 20,000 people. Critics say he should be more generous. <br><br>
                    The Afghans who have arrived so far are among the more than 15,000 who flew to the UK during the
                    NATO evacuation. <br><br>
                    US, UK and other NATO troops guard the airport amid chaos in Kabul as desperate Afghans try to flee
                    the Taliban. <br><br>
                    Johnson declined to support Defense Secretary Ben Wallace's proposal that Afghans should travel to
                    neighboring countries instead. <br><br>
                    He said the UK hopes to use political and financial pressure on the Taliban to keep the door open
                    for commercial flights after August 31. <br><br>
                    Some Afghan bank accounts have been blocked since the fall of Kabul. The G7 countries have linked
                    cooperation with the Taliban with a number of other requirements, including the fact that
                    Afghanistan should not become a center of terrorists, as it was before 9/11. <br><br>
                    “We really hope that the Taliban will understand that there must be a sensible approach to people
                    who still want to leave Afghanistan,” Johnson said. <br><br>
                    “If they want to participate in development aid, if they want to unlock these billions of funds, if
                    they want diplomatic or political relations with the outside world, then a safe passage for those
                    who want to leave is a key precondition. "

                    During the pandemic, the tax authority made it possible for those unable to pay taxes or investigate
                    compliance to defer payments or intervene where possible. <br><br>
                    In turn, the compliance rate “remained below its normal pre-pandemic level” over the three-month

                    The ruling is likely to bring renewed attention to the quality of audit work performed by the UK's
                    top accountants following the publication of the latest results of the FRC audit quality audit in
                    July. Sir John Thompson, Chief Executive Officer of FRC, concluded that "significant changes still
                    need to occur to substantially improve audit quality." <br><br>
                    EY stated that it "did not meet the standards we set for ourselves." <br><br>
                    The FRC said EY's deficiencies in Stagecoach relate to three specific areas, including an onerous
                    contract clause regarding the East Coast rail franchise that the company operated with Virgin Trains
                    from 2014 until its re-nationalization in 2018. <br><br>
                    Former UK Transport Secretary Chris Grayling got the franchise back after Stagecoach reported heavy
                    contract losses. <br><br>
                    The FRC stated that the sanctions imposed on EY in connection with the Stagecoach audit are also
                    linked to certain retirement plan obligations and provisions for insurance claims related to
                    accidents. <br><br>
                    “All three audit areas concerned material residues and were identified by respondents as areas of
                    significant risk requiring increased auditor attention,” the FRC said in a statement. <br><br>
                    The supervisory body ruled that the “most serious deficiencies” in the audit of EY Stagecoach
                    “related to the lack of sufficient appraisal and performance problems by the relevant management
                    experts and respondents, and the consequent lack of proper management challenging the significant
                    underlying assumptions. financial reporting ". <br><br>
                    “Although it is not alleged that the financial statements were actually misstated, in several
                    significant cases respondents were unable to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence and did
                    not display sufficient professional skepticism in conducting the audit,” the FRC said in a
                    statement. <br><br>
                    “In addition, the content and volume of audit documentation that respondents were required to
                    prepare was of low quality, which did not reflect the full scope of procedures and judgments made.”
                    <br><br>
                    But the FRC added: "The violation of the relevant requirements was not willful, dishonest, willful
                    or reckless." <br><br>
                    The FRC stated that EY has taken steps to identify the causes of audit errors related to one year of
                    audit and has taken steps to address those issues. He noted that EY "provided a good level of
                    cooperation during the investigation." <br><br>
                    Claudia Mortimore, Deputy Executive Adviser of FRC, said: “The audit shortcomings in this case were
                    widespread and related to a number of fundamental auditing standards, including the requirement to
                    obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence, adequate expert judgment, exercise of sufficient
                    professional skepticism and challenge. management and prepare appropriate audit documentation.
                    <br><br>
                    "The sanctions imposed reflect the severity of the violations and are intended to improve the
                    quality of future audits." <br><br>
                    The penalties imposed on EY were reduced to £ 2.2m, 10% less for mitigating factors and 30% for
                    admission and early removal. Mr. Harvey, who was also severely reprimanded, received a 30% penalty
                    cut to £ 70,000 for hospitalization and early termination. He left EY last summer to become Arnold
                    Clark's CFO and was replaced by Ellie Scott. <br><br>
                    EY said in a statement: “Auditing builds confidence and confidence in the economy, and conducting
                    high quality audits is an absolute priority for us. Unfortunately, in this case, we did not reach
                    the standards that we set for ourselves, and the standards that FRC and society expect of us.
                    <br><br>
                    “We have worked with FRC throughout the investigation, take their findings very seriously and have
                    worked hard to fix the issues identified. The FRC review of our most recent end-2020 audit of the
                    company did not draw any conclusions. We continue to invest heavily in audit quality at EY and on 1
                    July this year we created a new UK audit executive and remuneration committee. This will support our
                    focus on delivering the highest audit quality by creating a culture of challenge and providing
                    independent oversight of our audit. <br><br>
                    “We remain committed to working with FRC and other stakeholders to raise standards in the auditing
                    profession and to ensure that the UK's corporate governance and audit system remains the world's
                    leading company.”

                    Earlier this month, teens across Scotland and the rest of the UK received their Scottish National
                    Certification and GCSE results, and many are now considering their future options. If they choose to
                    pursue full-time education or vocational training, parents and guardians will be eligible to
                    continue to
                    receive child support for their child. <br><br>
                    HMRC is sending letters to families receiving Child Support for their child in the last year of
                    school
                    or home schooling reminding them that if their child continues to study after age 16, HMRC must be
                    notified by the August 31st deadline or payments may stop. <br><br>
                    The GOV.UK website makes it quick and easy to update your child support records. <br><br>
                    Alternatively, parents or guardians can simply return the Form 297b sent to them by HMRC. <br><br>
                    Child support is paid to eligible parents or guardians who are responsible for a child under the age
                    of
                    16 or under the age of 20 if they are in full-time work, non-vocational education, or approved
                    training. <br><br>
                    A parent or guardian receiving Child Support with an income of more than £ 50,000, or their partner,
                    may
                    be required to pay the High-Income Child Support fee through an Annual Self-Assessment Tax Return.
                    <br><br>
                    HMRC also reminds customers that the Post Office Card accounts are being closed and that from
                    November
                    30, 2021, it will stop transferring Child Benefit, Guardian Benefit and Tax Credits to these
                    accounts. <br><br>
                    Anyone still using the post office to collect benefits is advised to contact HMRC as soon as
                    possible
                    with the details of their new bank, building society or credit union. <br><br>
